# SQL Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates structured data analysis using SQL on a relational database consisting of **4 interconnected tables**. The dataset contains **70,000+ rows combined**, enabling meaningful querying, aggregation, and insights generation.

## 🗂️ Database Structure

The database is designed with the following **four tables**:

* Each table represents a distinct business entity
* Tables are linked using appropriate primary and foreign keys
* The schema supports efficient joins and analytical queries

## 📊 Dataset Details

* **Total Records:** 70,000+ rows
* **Data Type:** Structured relational data
* **Scope:** Suitable for advanced SQL operations such as joins, subqueries, window functions, and aggregations

## 🔍 Key SQL Concepts Used

* `JOIN` operations across multiple tables
* `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions
* Subqueries and nested queries
* Window functions (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`)
* Filtering and sorting for insights

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:

* Practice real-world SQL data analysis
* Extract meaningful insights from large datasets
* Demonstrate database querying and optimization skills

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server – as applicable)
* Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

## ✅ Outcome

This project showcases the ability to work with **large-scale relational datasets**, apply advanced SQL techniques, and present clear analytical results.
